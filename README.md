## 🏃 Getting Started

Before we delve into the crux of the matter, please ensure you have Python 3.8 (or newer) installed on your system. Don't worry; we'll patiently wait for you to get it done. Python in place? Fantastic! Let's proceed.

The installation of Meta Human Server is a breeze. Simply clone this repository and navigate to the project root directory. Then, execute the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're asking, "That's it?" Yes, you're absolutely correct. That's it!

## 🏗 Architecture

Meta Human Server is built around a modular and flexible architecture, compartmentalizing different tasks into different functions to keep the system clean and maintainable. Here's a brief overview of the critical steps involved:

1. **Wake word detection**: Our application is always listening, eagerly waiting for you to call its name. If you say "Computer," the magic starts!

2. **Audio recording**: Once activated, Meta Human Server will record your voice prompt and save it as an audio file.

3. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: This recorded audio is then converted into text using a powerful STT model.

4. **Processing with ChatGPT**: The text is then fed into OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate a chatbot response.

5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The generated text is converted back to audio using a fast TTS model.

6. **Audio playback**: The audio response is then played back to you. How's that for a conversation!

For each of these steps, we have separate modules handling the job, making Meta Human Server highly scalable and customizable. 

## 🛠 Usage

To fire up Meta Human Server, use the following commands:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will immediately start listening. To initiate a conversation, just say "Computer," followed by your query. To start a new conversation, use the wake word "porcupine."

## ❓ FAQs

**Q. Why is my chatbot not responding?**

A. Ensure that the microphone is correctly connected and working. Also, check if the wake word "Computer" is clearly spoken.

**Q. Can I change the wake word?**

A. As of now, the wake word is hard-coded. However, you can easily modify this by tweaking the source code.

**Q. What languages does the chatbot support?**

A. Currently, Meta Human Server only supports English.
