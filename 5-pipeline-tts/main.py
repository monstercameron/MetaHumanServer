According to historical records, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a pistol. His long-time partner, Eva Braun, took poison and died alongside him. The exact details of Hitler's and Eva Braun's deaths were not widely known until years after the war. It's important to note that Hitler's death is a historical fact, and there are no credible sources that suggest he survived the war and lived a secret life afterward.",
